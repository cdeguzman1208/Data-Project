# Data-Project
**A Data Visualization** that uses a static data source

*In this context, a static data source means data that is unchanging once its implemented into the project, not utilizing a dynamic or user selected dataset*
- The Visualization must have interactive elements. This can be filters, drag/zoom/expand, gameplay, clickable animations, or more. Look to Explorabl.es for inspiration

Filters, scroll zoom, hover over tooltips.

- Include source links to your data. Where did you get the data, and were you able to confirm its validity? *(you can answer these in the comments of your submission or in the project itself)*

Dataset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_instruments_(music) -> Manually converted into CSV

- In the submission comments, give your reasoning for why you chose the visualization format for this data (medium is the message)
  - Why did you choose this particular form of visualization? What benefit does it give to the statement of data?

I have a genuine love for music and find the national instruments of world countries to be a fasinating cultural niche. The benefit of this visualization is to promote diversity and interconnectedness through music education.
